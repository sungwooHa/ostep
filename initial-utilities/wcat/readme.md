# Details
- Your program wcat can be invoked with one or more files on the command line; it should just print out each file in turn.
- In all non-error cases, wcat should exit with status code 0, usually by returning a 0 from main() (or by calling exit(0)).
- If no files are specified on the command line, wcat should just exit and return 0. Note that this is slightly different than the behavior of normal UNIX cat (if you'd like to, figure out the difference).
- If the program tries to fopen() a file and fails, it should print the exact message "wcat: cannot open file" (followed by a newline) and exit with status code 1. If multiple files are specified on the command line, the files should be printed out in order until the end of - the file list is reached or an error opening a file is reached (at which point the error message is printed and wcat exits).
